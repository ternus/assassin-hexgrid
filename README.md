Assassin Hexgrid
================

A hex-grid mechanic webapp for [MIT Assassins' Guild][] ten-day
games.

Originally written by [Jim Waldrop][] for the game Final Fantasy:
Yielding Stone (Spring 2008), it served as the "archives" in that game
-- a set of books linking to one another.

The code was then heavily modified by [Christian Ternus][] to act as
a "black market" for the game Thebes (IAP 2009).  In this game, the
nodes were individual merchants introducing the player to one another.

As of now (December 2012) the code has not been touched in nearly four
years.  It will likely need considerable work for your game.

The code uses [TurboGears][] to run, as well as Python imaging
libraries (I think) to generate the dynamic hexgrid maps.

Enjoy!
